# SWAPI Challenge

Project developed to know for all S.W. starships and how many stops for resupply are required to cover a given distance.

### Prerequisites

Having docker installed and an IDE (my preference is Visual Studio 2017+)

### Installing

If you are running through Visual Studio, just make sure that the project selected for execution is docker-compose and give play in the debug.

If it is not, just run the docker-compose via terminal, being able to access the project folder and execute the 'docker-compose up' command.

## Running the tests (Unit Tests)

The test project is named 'Swapi_based_resupply_distance.tests', if you are using Visual Studio, simply go to the Test> Run> All Tests tab and follow the results in the 'Test Explorer' window.
